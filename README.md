# Image analyzer
Version 0.1 (2025)

By Benoît Saint-Moulin (BSM3D)

## Overview

Image analyzer is an advanced web application designed to analyze and identify images potentially generated by artificial intelligence. It uses multiple analysis vectors and provides detailed insights into image characteristics.

## Privacy & Security

- 100% Client-side processing
- Do not use AI ;)
- No data storage or cloud upload
- No registration required
- Free to use, code publicly available

## Demo

you can use and try it : https://bsm3d.com/img_analyzer/

## Features

### 1. Comprehensive Image Analysis
- Pattern detection
- Texture analysis
- Color distribution analysis
- Symmetry detection
- Noise pattern analysis
- Compression artifacts detection

### 2. Key Detection Indicators

#### Color Analysis
- Unique colors count (higher count typically indicates real photos)
- Color banding detection
- Color transition analysis
- Saturation variance

#### Technical Patterns
- Edge detection
- Repetitive pattern analysis
- Texture uniformity
- Natural vs artificial noise detection

#### Metadata Analysis
- EXIF data extraction and verification
- Camera settings analysis
- Geolocation data (when available)

### 3. Training Mode (Deep Analysis)
- Comparative analysis between real and AI-generated images
- Statistical pattern recognition
- Detailed comparison reports
- Custom threshold calibration

## Reliability and Limitations

### Understanding the Results

The tool provides probability-based analysis and should not be considered as absolute proof. Several factors affect reliability:

1. **Strengths**
   - Multi-vector analysis approach
   - Statistical pattern recognition
   - EXIF data verification
   - Color distribution analysis

2. **Limitations**
   - No 100% accuracy guarantee
   - Possible false positives/negatives
   - AI technology evolves rapidly
   - Image quality dependency

### Key Reliability Indicators

1. **EXIF Data**
   - Presence of EXIF data suggests real photo (but can be spoofed)
   - Complete EXIF data with camera settings is a strong indicator
   - Note: Advanced AI users can add EXIF data

2. **Color Analysis**
   - Real photos typically have more unique colors
   - AI generations tend to optimize and reduce color count
   - Natural color transitions vs artificial patterns

3. **Noise Patterns**
   - Natural photos have random noise patterns
   - AI-generated images often show regular noise patterns
   - Perfect transitions are suspicious

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Basic Analysis**
   - Upload image for quick analysis
   - Review overall probability score
   - Check detected indicators
   - Examine EXIF data if available

2. **Deep Analysis Mode**
   - Load multiple reference images (both AI and real)
   - Generate comparative analysis
   - Review detailed statistical reports
   - Use for higher precision requirements

3. **Best Practices**
   - Combine tool results with human judgment
   - Consider context and image source
   - Use multiple detection methods
   - Stay critical and analytical

## Technical Requirements
- Modern web browser
- JavaScript enabled
- Minimum 4GB RAM recommended

**Note**: This tool provides probability-based analysis and should be used as part of a broader verification process, not as a standalone proof of image authenticity.
