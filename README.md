# Image Analyzer
Version 0.1 (2025)
By Benoît (BSM3D) Saint-Moulin 

## Overview

Image Analyzer emerges as a revolutionary web application designed to tackle one of the most pressing challenges in the digital age: identifying images generated by artificial intelligence. In a world where visual content is increasingly complex and potentially deceptive, this tool offers a sophisticated, transparent approach to image authentication.

The application represents a paradigm shift in how we understand and verify digital imagery. By employing multiple analytical vectors, Image Analyzer provides users with a comprehensive toolkit for examining the origins and authenticity of visual content. It goes beyond simple detection, offering a nuanced, probabilistic assessment that empowers users to make informed judgments about the images they encounter.

## Privacy & Security

The tool stands in stark contrast to conventional image detection solutions. Where many commercial products rely on invasive data collection and complex, opaque algorithms, Image Analyzer is built on a foundation of transparency, user privacy, and ethical technology development.

Key privacy principles include 100% client-side processing, meaning all analysis occurs directly within the user's browser. There is no data storage, no cloud uploads, and no registration requirements. The entire application is free to use and comes with publicly available source code, allowing for complete transparency and community verification.

- 100% Client-side processing
- No AI model training
- No data storage or cloud upload
- No registration required
- Free to use, code publicly available

**Note**: This tool provides probability-based analysis and should be used as part of a broader verification process, not as a standalone proof of image authenticity.
