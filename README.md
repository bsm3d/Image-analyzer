# Image Analyzer
Version 0.1 (2025)
By Benoît Saint-Moulin (BSM3D)

## Overview
Image Analyzer is an advanced web application designed to analyze and identify images potentially generated by artificial intelligence. It uses multiple analysis vectors and provides detailed insights into image characteristics through a comprehensive, privacy-focused approach.

## Privacy & Security
- 100% Client-side processing
- No AI model training
- No data storage or cloud upload
- No registration required
- Free to use, code publicly available

**Note**: This tool provides probability-based analysis and should be used as part of a broader verification process, not as a standalone proof of image authenticity.

## Reliability and Limitations

### Understanding the Results
The tool provides probability-based analysis and should not be considered absolute proof.

Strengths:
- Multi-vector analysis approach
- Statistical pattern recognition
- EXIF data verification
- Color distribution analysis

Limitations:
- No 100% accuracy guarantee
- Potential false positives/negatives
- Rapidly evolving AI technology
- Dependency on image quality

### Key Reliability Indicators
1. EXIF Data
   - Presence of EXIF data suggests a real photo
   - Complete camera settings are strong indicators
   - Advanced users can potentially spoof EXIF data

2. Color Analysis
   - Real photos typically have more unique colors
   - AI generations tend to optimize and reduce color count
   - Analyze natural color transitions

3. Noise Patterns
   - Natural photos have random noise patterns
   - AI-generated images often show regular noise patterns
   - Suspicious perfect transitions

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Basic Analysis
- Upload image for quick analysis
- Review overall probability score
- Check detected indicators
- Examine EXIF data

### 2. Deep Analysis Mode
- Load multiple reference images
